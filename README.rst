Portcheck
=========

Utility to check if all commits in a git source branch are represented as ports
in the target branch

Usage
-----

::

  portcheck [-v] <source-ref> [<target-ref>]

Options
-------

- :code:`-v`: enables verbose mode
- :code:`source-ref`: branch or other ref containing commits that require port
- :code:`target-ref`: branch or other ref containing port commits (defaults to
  :code:`HEAD`)

Ports
-----

Ports of commit :code:`commit-sha` are detected by having one of the following
lines in the commit message:

::

  (port from commit <commit-sha>)
  (cherry picked from commit <commit-sha>)

The :code:`commit-sha` must be the complete SHA of the commit as returned by
:code:`git rev-parse ref`. The search is case insensitive.

The latter line can be generated by git when cherry picking by using the
:code:`-x` flag: :code:`git cherry-pick -x <commit sha>`.
